See below table of UFO sightings data. Filters are available to search by key meta data related to each entry (i.e., date, city, etc.)

## Summary
This webpage is great for a single use reference point but it lacks in the capability to continuously update new sightings. The moment this is posted, it will already be out of date, potentially. Not sure how many alien sightings will happen today! I would probably find a source to scrape data from, if there is one, not sure if there are government resources that are publically available to track this kind of information.
